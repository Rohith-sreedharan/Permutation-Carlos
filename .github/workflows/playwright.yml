            ### Atomic Decision Integrity Tests
            - Debug overlay renders all canonical fields
            - Spread + Total atomic fields match (Charlotte vs Atlanta bug prevention)
            - Refresh stability verified
            - Race condition test (newest bundle wins)
            - Real data validation (no mock teams)
